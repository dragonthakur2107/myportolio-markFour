            <h3>How I started coding.</h3>
            <p>Until i was not in college i did not know about coding. I was very much interested in computer related stuff, like pc building and all i always wanted to be in a field where i could get my hands on a computer and that's the reason why i chose programming as a career. When I was in first year of my college i learnt C and then i learnt C++ in the 2nd year. These two languages helped me alot in understanding the basics of programming and the core of it. It is a fact that if you know some basics of coding you will have a little bit of advantage while learning through out the camp. 
            </p>

            <h3>My first Interaction with neog</h3>
            <p>I came to know about neog camp from my senior. Then i started watching videos. I was not knowing about neog camp when Tanay used to teach live. I watched the introduction video and man, ask me how excited i got. Then i started watching videos and then made projects later.</p>
            <h4>Knowing Tanay</h4>
                <small>Tanay is a calm and collected teacher. He is a great singer as well(lol). He would never get frustrated and was always ready to answer the same question twice or even thrice. He is so good with teaching that his teaching would not even feel like teaching. It would go like a fun activity. He would give us breaks and never rushed into finishing his part he is a great guy. I can assure you he is the Idol of all neoGrammers</small>

            <h3>Start of the learning part</h3>
            <p>I started learning step by step how Tanay taught. Approach had no difference either, I would watch the whole video and then start building my own part later. When i started coding my own version of what Tanay taught, I would love to do it and was never bored once, I was so excited that i would do the bonus part as well. Learning in first three videos was pretty easy. In the first video we learnt about the javaScript and creating a CLI app using it. Which came to me very easily as I knew programming. Even if i wasn't, the way to teaching was so simple a kid would get it.</p>
           
            <h3>Hosting a website.</h3>
            <p>In the second session we learnt how ot work in a professional space using git tech, how to host a website, and ho to create your own website. There wasn't much to understand in this session, but it was very interseting and fun to understand.</p>

            <h3>Experience making my own portfolio website</h3>
            <p>The days of resumes are gone. The person who hire you will never look at your resume and give you the job, but will look for the skills you have and the work you can manage to do. That's where your website comes in, which you can give to person hiring. Making website for my portfolio was very interseting and it was so fun i would always look for adding new things to my website. I think my portfolio website will always give me a confident boost whenever i will be giving an interview. Adding projects and writing blogs part was pretty fun. Also this was the first time i learnt HTML5 and CSS3 basics.</p>

            <h3>Making apps and moving on with the projects.</h3>
            <p>It started getting even more interesting and challenging when we came to the part where we had to wire html with javaScript, i loved it, We created something that I could tell my friends about and say that "I made this". Yes, th translation API. After making two API apps as my markSix and Seven, i took a short break for my college exams. After one month i started with reactJS session.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Shock and Breakdown</h3>
            <p>
                When i started doing the Emoji Interpreter, it was easy react felt like home. But then ".map()" function came into my life and I was devastated, i would not be able to understand how should i use this function to make my markNine, This was the first time when i left a project incomplete. Ater few days i checked the neog website and got shocked when i saw 6 new projects incoming and now I had to make 7 in total. I was not able to understand the problem and lost hope for sometime but then I realised,that I have time to work things out. I started understanding the concepts and somehow built my app for markNine. And then Tanay started to sessions for mark11 to 14 learning from there, I completed my projects till mark14. As a final piece i wrote this second blog to complete my portfolio. Know i will get some reviews and then submit my portfolio.
            </p>

            <p>
                It has been a good journey for levelZero and I look forward to go in levelOne and learn from an amazing teacher and work with some great friends.</p>
